There are 4 main files: 
1. ./controllers/product.js, this has all the fuctions the API's call.
2. ./models.js, this has all the models of the database tables.
3. ./routes/index.js, this has all the API's paths, the type of API's they are (get, put, post, patch, delete) and the functions they call.
4. ./index.js, this is the entry point and has the cron job written in it (For making new rows in the databse for daily entries).
